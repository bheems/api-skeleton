# api-skeleton
# NodeJS
Using this as a template to build out quick APIs, by reference.

  - Handles asynchronous calls with "request-promise" module
  
    - should use async/await for making larger number of requests
    
  - Response payload should be broken down into clean data to be stored into a database
  
  - Meant for APIs that require retrieving OAuth token (by encoding user's credentials as base64 string, or with direct/bypassing credentials)
    - if user credentials are needed, store them in another file 
  
  - Test through Postman/Insomnia
